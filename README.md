... codeplex is dead, long lifes github ...

We have moved the source code for TFS Event Workflows from [Codeplex](https://tfseventworkflows.codeplex.com/) to GitHub

So please post your thoughts under issues!

Regarding the current Status (esp. supported TFS Versions) pls. look at the [Issue - Currently at GitHub only the source code is available](https://github.com/ttrotzki/tfseventworkflows/issues/1).
